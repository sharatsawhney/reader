It was first published by Chapman &amp; Hall on 19 December 1843. Carol tells the story of a bitter old miser named Ebenezer Scrooge and his transformation resulting from a supernatural visit by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley and the Ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Yet to Come. The novella met with instant success and critical acclaim. The book was written and published in early Victorian era Britain, a period when there was strong nostalgia for old Christmas traditions together with the introduction of new customs, such as Christmas trees and greeting cards. Dickens' sources for the tale appear to be many and varied, but are, principally, the humiliating experiences of his childhood, his sympathy for the poor, and various Christmas stories and fairy tales</span><br></p>",8,bookActive,,0,0.0,2004-08-11,Charles Dickens,None,"Fiction, Literature & Novels",3month,"[4, 8]","[4, 8]","[4, 8]","['Language and Literature', 'Christmas stories']"

The story is set in the late 18th century against the background of the French Revolution. Although Dickens borrowed from Thomas Carlyle's history, The French Revolution, for his sprawling tale of London and revolutionary Paris, the novel offers more drama than accuracy. The scenes of large-scale mob violence are especially vivid, if superficial in historical understanding. The complex plot involves Sydney Carton's sacrifice of his own life on behalf of his friends Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette. While political events drive the story, Dickens takes a decidedly antipolitical tone, lambasting both aristocratic tyranny and revolutionary excess--the latter memorably caricatured in Madame Defarge, who knits beside the guillotine. The book is perhaps best known for its opening lines, ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,"" and for Carton's last speech, in which he says of his replacing Darnay in a prison cell, ""It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known."" -- The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</span><br></p>",8,bookActive,,0,0.0,1994-01-01,Charles Dickens,None,"Fiction, Literature & Novels",3month,"[4, 10, 11]","[4, 10, 11]","[4, 10, 11]","['Language and Literature', 'Historical fiction', 'War stories']"

Tom Sawyer, a mischievous orphan taken in by his Aunt Polly, goes through a series of adventures involving his friends, Joe Harper, and Huckleberry Finn. Tom is a mischevious mastermind and a professional trickster. He escapes punishment many times by his tricks and charms. Though he is often foolish and unpredictable, he also is somewhat smart and has a good sense of humor. When not trying to win his sweetheart, Becky Thatcher, Tom is either getting into mischief or going on an adventure. Many times, Tom suddenly changes from his grinning self into a fearsome pirate or anything else he can think of. His laugh changes into a bloodcurdling yell or a barking captain`s voice. Tom Sawyer`s main doings are racing bugs, impressing girls with fights and stunts in the schoolyard, getting lost in a cave, and playing pirates on the Mississippi River. The best-known passage in the book describes how Sawyer persuades his friends to whitewash or paint, along with the fence for him.</span><br></p>",7,bookActive,,0,0.0,2004-07-01,Mark Twain,None,"Fiction, Literature & Novels",3month,"[4, 16, 34, 35, 36]","[4, 16, 34, 35, 36]","[4, 16, 34, 35, 36]","['Language and Literature', 'Adventure stories', 'Fiction', 'Humorous stories', 'Male friendship']"

Epic in scale, it is regarded as one of the central works of world literature. It is considered Tolstoy's finest literary achievement, along with his other major prose work, Anna Karenina (1873–1877). War and Peace delineate in graphic detail events surrounding the French invasion of Russia, and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society, as seen through the eyes of five Russian aristocratic families. Portions of an earlier version of the novel, then known as The Year 1805, were serialized in the magazine The Russian Messenger between 1865 and 1867. The novel was first published in its entirety in 1869. Newsweek in 2009 ranked it first in its list of the Top 100 Books. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 20 on the BBC's survey The Big Read. Tolstoy himself, somewhat enigmatically, said of War and Peace that it is ""not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less a historical chronicle"". Large sections of the work, especially in the later chapters, are a philosophical discussion rather than narrative. He went on to elaborate that the best Russian literature does not conform to standards and hence hesitated to call War and Peace a novel.

E. B. Du Bois. It is a seminal work in the history of sociology, and a cornerstone of African-American literary history. The book, published in 1903, contains several essays on race, some of which had been previously published in Atlantic Monthly magazine. Du Bois drew from his own experiences to develop this groundbreaking work on being African-American in American society. Outside of its notable place in African-American history, The Souls of Black Folk also holds an important place in social science as one of the early works to deal with sociology. Chapter I lays out an overview of Du Bois's thesis for the book: that the blacks of South need the right to vote, a good education, and to be treated with equality and justice. The first chapter also introduces Du Bois' famous metaphor of the veil. According to Du Bois, this veil is worn by all African-Americans because their view of the world and its potential economic, political, and social opportunities is so vastly different from that of white people. The veil is a visual manifestation of the color line, a problem Du Bois worked his whole life to remedy. Du Bois sublimates the function of the veil when he refers to it as a gift of second sight for African-Americans, thus simultaneously characterizing the veil as both a blessing and a curse.[1] The second chapter, ""The Dawn of Freedom"" covers the history of the Freedman's Bureau during reconstruction. Chapters III through VI focus on education. Du Bois argues against Booker T. Washington's idea of focusing solely on industrial education for black men and advocates the addition of a classical education to establish leaders and educators in the black community. Chapters VII through X is sociological studies of the black community. Du Bois investigates the influence that segregation and discrimination have had on the black people. He argues that much of the negative stereotypes of blacks as lazy, violent, and simple-minded are results of the treatment from white people. In ""Chapter X: Of the Faith of the Fathers"", Du Bois describes the rise of the Black church and examines the history and contemporary state of religion and spiritualism among African-Americans. The final chapters of the book are devoted to narratives of individuals. ""Chapter XI: Of the Passing of the First-Born,"" tells the story of Du Bois's own son and his untimely death. In the next chapter, the life of Alexander Crummell is a short biography of a black priest in the Episcopal Church. ""Chapter XIII: Of the Coming of John"" is the fictional account of a boy from Georgia who goes off to college and, on his return is rejected by both his black community and the white patricians of his town. The last chapter is about Negro music and makes reference to the short musical passages at the beginning of each of the other chapters. In Living Black History, Du Bois biographer Manning Marable observes: Few books make history and fewer still become foundational texts for the movements and struggles of an entire people. The Souls of Black Folk occupies this rare position. It helped to create the intellectual argument for the black freedom struggle in the twentieth century. Souls justified the pursuit of higher education for Negroes and thus contributed to the rise of the black middle class. By describing a global color-line, Du Bois anticipated pan-Africanism and colonial revolutions in the Third World. Moreover, this stunning critique of how 'race' is lived through the normal aspects of daily life is central to what would become known as 'whiteness studies' a century later.</span><br></p>",7,bookActive,,0,0.0,1996-01-01,W.

A leading transcendentalist, Thoreau is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay Resistance to Civil Government (also known as Civil Disobedience), an argument for disobedience to an unjust state. Thoreau's Civil Disobedience espouses the need to prioritize one's conscience over the dictates of laws. It criticizes American social institutions and policies, most prominently slavery and the Mexican-American War. Thoreau begins his essay by arguing that government rarely proves itself useful and that it derives its power from the majority because they are the strongest group, not because they hold the most legitimate viewpoint. He contends that people’s first obligation is to do what they believe is right and not to follow the law dictated by the majority.</p><div><br></div>",7,bookActive,,0,0.0,1995-01-01,Henry David Thoreau,None,"Fiction, Literature & Novels",3month,"[10, 57, 59]","[10, 57, 59]","[10, 57, 59]","['Historical fiction', 'Social life', 'Biography']"

He learns from an acquaintance of the availability of a flat for which the current prospective occupant is looking for a roommate to split the rent. The flat is 221B Baker Street, the current prospective occupant, Sherlock Holmes. Upon meeting Sherlock, Watson quickly learns that Mr. Holmes is a consulting detective and gets swept up in the mystery of a fresh murder case being investigated by Scotland Yard. The two investigate an abandoned house off the Brixton Road where a body is found in a blood-stained room with the word ""rache,"" German for ""revenge"" scrawled on the wall in blood.

The Washington Post calls Marx 'an astute critic of capitalism.' Writing in The NewYork Times, Columbia University Professor Steven Marcus describes the Manifesto as a 'masterpiece' with 'enduring insights into social existence.'Since it was first written in 1848, the Manifesto by Marx and Engels has been translated into more languages than any other modern text. It has been banned, censored, burned and declared 'dead'. But year after year, the text only grows more influential and more relevant and is required reading in courses on philosophy, politics, economics, and history. In this extensively researched edition, renowned Marxist scholar Phil Gasper provides an authoritative introduction to history's most important political document, with the full text of the Manifesto. Thoughtfully presented in a reader-friendly format, it is fully annotated, with clear historical references and explanations, additional related texts, and a glossary that will bring the text to life for students as well as the general reader.

He didn’t, shrugging off a career in law for adventure and the call of the Sea. The Sea, however, is a harsh mistress and soon Crusoe’s ship is wrecked in a storm. He is undeterred and returns again and again until he is finally stranded on an island. He begins making his way on the island, assuming that he is alone. He is not. His companions are savage cannibals, and he needs to stay away from them to stay alive. When he spots two prisoners among them, he helps one in his attempts to escape, naming him Friday. In doing so he forges the most singular friendship to have ever been portrayed in all of the fiction everywhere: that of the white man and the black savage, a friendship that will go down in history as that of Robinson Crusoe and Man Friday.

It remains the most often quoted book about the United States, not only because it has something to interest and please everyone, but also because it has something to teach everyone.

Keene’s is a haloed name among the path-breakers of the history of late mediaeval Indian history. He was one of those energetic and inquisitive colonial administrators, who not only ruled the British empire but were also busy discovering and describing the circumstances in which the foundation of that empire was laid. Keene started his judicial career under the East India Company and later served the British-Indian government, mostly in the then North-Western Province, now known as U.P. He was well-known for his knowledge of both Persian and Urdu, and made his mark as the author of The Moghul Empire from the Death of Aurungjeb, published in 1867. In recognition of his scholastic contribution he was elected a fellow of Calcutta University, whose jurisdiction extended across entire northern India, before the establishment of the Universities of Punjab and Allahabad. The present book, published nine years later in 1876, is some sort of a revised and updated follow-up of the earlier work, and covers the period, from the Third Battle of Panipat to the Second Anglo-Maratha War, obviously with North India at the centre of the focus. These forty years saw the virtual disappearance of the shadowy authority of the Moghul Badshah, the failure of the Marathas and any other power to fill in the void, and the ultimate emergence of the English East India Company as the undisputed master of Hindustan. So, although in the words of Keene himself it is essentially a history of a period of anarchy, it also for the first time, gives a dependable connected account of these tumultuous years pregnant with significant developments. However, being a pioneer work in this field, mostly based on available Persian sources and local traditions, it may be rather out-dated from the point of view of a modern scholar of this period. However, just as no river engineer can afford to ignore the source similarly those fortunate to have before them the researches done in the last over a century cannot afford to ignore the giants who had shown their predecessors their way. It is one of those timeless treasures, which shines brighter with passing years.</span><br></p>",6,bookActive,,0,0.0,1998-09-01,H. G.

The latter was enabled, as the years went on, to enormously increase her Reserves, so that she has had men trained in and at the cost of, India.</p><p style=""margin-top: -4px; margin-bottom: 14px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">In 186 3 the Indian army consisted of men, with white officers. Great changes were made in 1 885-1905, including the reorganization under Lord Kitchener, who became Commander-in-Chief at the end of 1902. Even in this hasty review, I must not omit reference to the fact that Army Stores were drawn from Britain at enormous cost, while they should have been chieﬂy manufactured here so that India might have profited by the expenditure. Lately, under the necessities of War, factories have been turned to the production of munitions; but this should have been done long ago so that India might have been enriched instead of exploited. The War has forced an investigation into her mineral resources that might have been made for her own sake, but Germany was allowed to monopolize the supply of minerals that India could have produced and worked up and would have produced and worked up had she enjoyed Home Rule. India would have been richer, and the Empire safer, had she been a partner instead of a possession. But this side of the question will come under the matters directly affecting merchants, and we may venture to express a hope that the Government help extended to munition factories in time of War may be continued to industrial factories In the time of Peace. The net result of the various causes above-mentioned was that the expense of the Indian army rose by leaps and bounds, until, before the War, India was expending 75 as against the f: expended by the United Kingdom, while the wealthy Dominions of Canada and Australia were spending only 1 - 5 and 121, millions respectively.

He has himself given us the history of this discovery. It appears that, on his arrival in Bengal, he was very solicitous to procure access to certain books called Nátaks, of which he had read in one of the 'Lettres Édifiantes et Curieuses' written by the Jesuit Missionaries of China. But, although he sought information by consulting both Bráhmans and Europeans, he was wholly unable for some time to satisfy his curiosity as to the nature of these books. It was reported to him that they were not histories, as he had hoped, but that they abounded with fables, and consisted of conversations in prose and verse held before ancient Rájás, in their public assemblies. Others, again, asserted that they were discourses on dancing, music, and poetry. At length, a sensible Bráhman, conversant with European manners, removed all his doubts, and gave him no less delight than surprise, by telling him that the English nation had compositions of the same sort, which were publicly represented at Calcutta in the cold season, and bore the name of 'plays.' The same Bráhman, when asked which of these Nátaks was most universally esteemed, answered without hesitation, '[S']akoontalá.' We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades. The contents of the vast majority of titles in the Classic Library have been scanned from the original works.

The work does not claim to be exhaustive in the sense that it gives a list of all the poets that ever came under that influence.It is hoped that the material presented in the case of each poet is sufficient to give a clear idea of the extent to which he was subject to Oriental influence, as well as of the part that he took in the movement under discussion.

Little I knew at the time how big the moment was with destiny, or how often that face seen in the fitful moonlight would haunt my sleep and disturb my waking hours. But I mind yet the cold grue of terror I got from it, a terror which was surely more than the due of a few truant lads breaking the Sabbath with their play. The town of Kirkcaple, of which and its adjacent parish of Portincross my father was the minister, lies on a hillside above the little bay of Caple, and looks squarely out on the North Sea. Round the horns of land which enclose the bay the coast shows on either side a battlement of stark red cliffs through which a burn or two makes a pass to the water's edge. The bay itself is ringed with fine clean sands, where we lads of the burgh school loved to bathe in the warm weather. But on long holidays the sport was to go farther afield among the cliffs; for there there were many deep caves and pools, where podleys might be caught with the line, and hid treasures sought for at the expense of the skin of the knees and the buttons of the trousers. Many a long Saturday I have passed in a crinkle of the cliffs, having lit a fire of driftwood, and made believe that I was a smuggler or a Jacobite new landed from France. There was a band of us in Kirkcaple, lads of my own age, including Archie Leslie, the son of my father's session-clerk, and Tam Dyke, the provost's nephew. We were sealed to silence by the blood oath, and we bore each the name of some historic pirate or sailorman. I was Paul Jones, Tam was Captain Kidd, and Archie, need I say it, was Morgan himself. Our tryst was a cave where a little water called the Dyve Burn had cut its way through the cliffs to the sea. There we forgathered in the summer evenings and of a Saturday afternoon in winter, and told mighty tales of our prowess and flattered our silly hearts. But the sober truth is that our deeds were of the humblest, and a dozen of fish or a handful of apples was all our booty, and our greatest exploit a fight with the roughs at the Dyve tan-work. My father's spring Communion fell on the last Sabbath of April, and on the particular Sabbath of which I speak the weather was mild and bright for the time of year. I had been surfeited with the Thursday's and Saturday's services, and the two long diets of worship on the Sabbath were hard for a lad of twelve to bear with the spring in his bones and the sun slanting through the gallery window. There still remained the service on the Sabbath evening—a doleful prospect, for the Rev. Mr Murdoch of Kilchristie, noted for the length of his discourses, had exchanged pulpits with my father. So my mind was ripe for the proposal of Archie Leslie, on our way home to tea, that by a little skill we might give the kirk the slip. At our Communion the pews were emptied of their regular occupants and the congregation seated itself as it pleased. The manse seat was full of the Kirkcaple relations of Mr Murdoch, who had been invited there by my mother to hear him, and it was not hard to obtain permission to sit with Archie and Tam Dyke in the cock-loft in the gallery. Word was sent to Tam, and so it happened that three abandoned lads duly passed the plate and took their seats in the cock-loft. But when the bell had done jowing, and we heard by the sounds of their feet that the elders had gone in to the kirk, we slipped down the stairs and out of the side door. We were through the churchyard in a twinkling, and hot-foot on the road to the Dyve Burn. It was the fashion of the genteel in Kirkcaple to put their boys into what were known as Eton suits—long trousers, cut-away jackets, and chimney-pot hats. I had been one of the earliest victims, and well I remember how I fled home from the Sabbath school with the snowballs of the town roughs rattling off my chimney-pot. Archie had followed, his family being in all things imitators of mine.</span><br></p>",6,bookActive,,0,0.0,1996-08-01,John Buchan,None,"Fiction, Literature & Novels",3month,"[16, 85]","[16, 85]","[16, 85]","['Adventure stories', 'Action']"

The University of Kent at Canterbury The Man in the Iron Mask is the final episode in the cycle of novels featuring Dumas celebrated foursome of D Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, who first appeared in The Three Musketeers. Some thirty-five years on, the bonds of comradeship are under strain as they end up on different sides in a power struggle that may undermine the young Louis XIV and change the face of the French monarchy. In the fast-paced narrative style that was his trademark, Dumas pitches us straight into the action. What is the secret shared by Aramis and Madame de Chevreuse? Why does the Queen Mother fear its revelation? Who is the mysterious prisoner in the Bastille? And what is the nature of the threat he poses? Dumas, the master storyteller, keeps us reading until the climactic scene in the grotto of Locmaria, a fitting conclusion to the epic saga of the Musketeers.</span><br></p>",7,bookActive,,0,0.0,2001-08-01,Alexandre Dumas,None,"Fiction, Literature & Novels",3month,"[10, 16, 67, 85]","[10, 16, 67, 85]","[10, 16, 67, 85]","['Historical fiction', 'Adventure stories', 'Romance ', 'Action']"

Three men of widely different types they were, yet all cradled in the same far-off northern land. The tallest, lean bodied but broad shouldered, black of hair and gray of eye, held himself in soldierly fashion and gazed unmoved. His two mates—one stocky, red faced and red headed; the other slender, bronzed and blond—betrayed their thoughts in their blue eyes. The red man squinted quizzically at the smoke feather as if it mattered little to him where he was. The blond watched it with the wistfulness of one who sees the last sign of his own world fade out. Behind them, at a respectful distance, a number of swarthy individuals of both sexes in nondescript garments smoked and stared at the trio with the interest always accorded strangers by the dwellers of the Out Places. They eyed the uncompromising back of the tall one, the easy lounge of the red one, the thoughtful attitude of the light one. The copper-faced men peered at the rifles hanging in the right hands of the newcomers, their knee boots, khaki clothing, and wide hats. The women let their eyes rove over the boxes and bundles reposing in the mud beside the three. ""Ingles?"" hazarded a woman, speaking through the stem of the black pipe clutched in her filed teeth. ""Notre-Americano,"" asserted a man, nodding toward the broad hats. ""Englishmen would wear the round helmets of pith."" ""Mercadores? Traders?"" suggested the woman, hopefully running an eye again over the bundles. ""Exploradores,"" the man corrected. ""Explorers of the bush. Have you no eyes? Do you not see the guns and high boots?"" The woman subsided. The others continued what seemed to be their only occupation—smoking. The smoke streamer in the north vanished. As if moved by the same impulse, the three strangers turned their heads and looked south-westward, upriver. The red-haired man spoke. ""So we've lit at last, as the feller said when him and his airyplane landed in a sewer. Faith, I dunno but he was better off than us, at that—he wasn't two thousand miles from nowheres like we are.

Contents Allan's Wife - the story of Quartermain's early life, and his marriage to childhood sweetheart, Stella, mother of his son Harry. Hunter Quatermain's Story A Tale of Three Lions Long Odds.... Sir Henry Rider Haggard, KBE, Kt ( 22 June 1856 – 14 May 1925), known as H. Rider Haggard, was an English writer of adventure novels set in exotic locations, predominantly Africa, and a pioneer of the Lost World literary genre.He was also involved in agricultural reform throughout the British Empire. His stories, situated at the lighter end of Victorian literature, continue to be popular and influential. Early years: Henry Rider Haggard, generally known as H. Rider Haggard or Rider Haggard, was born at Bradenham, Norfolk, the eighth of ten children, to Sir William Meybohm Rider Haggard, a barrister, and Ella Doveton, an author and poet. His father was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia, to British parents. Haggard was initially sent to Garsington Rectory in Oxfordshire to study under Reverend H. J. Graham, but unlike his elder brothers who graduated from various private schools, he attended Ipswich Grammar School. This was because his father, who perhaps regarded him as somebody who was not going to amount to much, could no longer afford to maintain his expensive private education. After failing his army entrance exam, he was sent to a private crammer in London to prepare for the entrance exam for the British Foreign Office, for which he never sat. During his two years in London he came into contact with people interested in the study of psychical phenomena. In 1875, Haggard's father sent him to what is now South Africa to take up an unpaid position as assistant to the secretary to Sir Henry Bulwer, Lieutenant-Governor of the Colony of Natal.[8] In 1876 he was transferred to the staff of Sir Theophilus Shepstone, Special Commissioner for the Transvaal. It was in this role that Haggard was present in Pretoria in April 1877 for the official announcement of the British annexation of the Boer Republic of the Transvaal. Indeed, Haggard raised the Union flag and read out much of the proclamation following the loss of voice of the official originally entrusted with the duty. South Africa, 1875–1882: At about that time, Haggard fell in love with Mary Elizabeth ""Lilly"" Jackson, whom he intended to marry once he obtained paid employment in Africa. In 1878 he became Registrar of the High Court in the Transvaal, and wrote to his father informing him that he intended to return to England and marry her. His father forbade it until Haggard had made a career for himself, and by 1879 Jackson had married Frank Archer, a well-to-do banker. When Haggard eventually returned to England, he married a friend of his sister, Marianna Louisa Margitson (1859–1943) in 1880, and the couple travelled to Africa together. They had a son named Jack (who died of measles at age 10) and three daughters, Angela, Dorothy and Lilias. Lilias Rider Haggard became an author, edited The Rabbit Skin Cap and I Walked By Night, and wrote a biography of her father entitled The Cloak That I Left (published in 1951).</span><br></p>",6,bookActive,,0,0.0,2006-03-28,H.

In the 1920's Mundy wrote stories about Tros of Samothrace, a Greek freedom fighter who aided Britons and Druids in their fight against Julius Caesar. Told in the East in s romance set in India. The story begins, ""A coppersmith was about the only living thing that seemed to care whether the sun went down or not. He seemed in a hurry to get a job done, and his reiterated ""Bong-bong-bong!""--that had never ceased since sunrise, and had driven nearly mad the few humans who were there to hear it--quickened and grew louder.

The family spends the summer at a colonial mansion that has, in the narrator's words, ""something queer about it"". She and her husband move into an upstairs room that she assumes was once a nursery. Her husband chooses for them to sleep there due to its multitude of windows, which provide the air so needed in her recovery. In addition to the couple, John's sister Jennie is present; she serves as their housekeeper. Like most nurseries at the time the windows are barred, the wallpaper has been torn, and the floor is scratched. The narrator attributes all these to children, as most of the damage is isolated to their reach.

With no stimulus other than the wallpaper, the pattern and designs become increasingly intriguing to the narrator. She soon begins to see a figure in the design, and eventually comes to believe that a woman is creeping on all fours behind the pattern. Believing she must try to free the woman in the wallpaper, the woman begins to strip the remaining paper off the wall.</p><p style=""margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: inherit; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: sans-serif;""><br></p>",7,bookActive,,0,0.0,1999-11-01,Charlotte Perkins Gilman,None,Short Stories & Poetry,3month,"[4, 5, 15, 31, 40]","[4, 5, 15, 31, 40]","[4, 5, 15, 31, 40]","['Language and Literature', 'Young women -- Fiction', 'Psychological fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Feminist fiction']"

They had been implanted in me with great care, and made an impression on my mind, which time could not erase, and which all the adversity and variety of fortune I have since experienced served only to rivet and record; for, whether the love of one's country be real or imaginary, or a lesson of reason, or an instinct of nature, I still look back with pleasure on the first scenes of my life, though that pleasure has been for the most part mingled with sorrow. -Olaudah Equiano</span><br></p>",6,bookActive,,0,0.0,2005-03-17,Olaudah Equiano,None,Biographies,3month,"[57, 66]","[57, 66]","[57, 66]","['Social life', 'Slavery']"

After encountering his old friend Tars Tarkas, Carter learns that they are in the Barsoomian afterlife. No, really. The problem is, nobody can return from the pilgrimage to the River Iss -- and if anyone tries, they will be killed.

Anyone who survives the valley is turned into a slave, and Carter soon makes new allies among his fellow captives. But even if he can escape the grasp of the ""goddess"" Issus, he may not be able to survive in a world where escaping from ""death"" is blasphemy -- especially when he finds that Dejah Thoris may be doomed as well.</div></span><div style=""text-align: justify;""><font color=""#111111"" face=""Amazon Ember, Arial, sans-serif""><br></font></div><span style=""font-size: 13px !important; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: &quot;Amazon Ember&quot;, Arial, sans-serif;""><div style=""text-align: justify;"">""The Gods of Mars"" is a much faster-moving story than the first Barsoom book, even though we're introduced to a whole new part of Mars and two new Martian species.

But he's still a very strong character, with lots of guts and courage.

The University of Kent at Canterbury. One of the most celebrated and popular historical romances ever written, The Three Musketeers tells the story of the early adventures of the young Gascon gentleman, D'Artagnan and his three friends from the regiment of the King's Musketeers - Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. Under the watchful eye of their patron M. de Treville, the four defend the honor of the regiment against the guards of Cardinal Richelieu, and the honor of the queen against the machinations of the Cardinal himself as the power struggles of seventeenth-century France are vividly played out in the background. But their most dangerous encounter is with the Cardinal's spy, Milady, one of literature's most memorable female villains, and Alexandre Dumas employ all his fast-paced narrative skills to bring this enthralling novel to a breathtakingly gripping and dramatic conclusion.
